The British then left the island and took settlement at Port Blair, since then the Island could never recover from the decay and neglect which had set in. Slowly but steadily the nature took its toll, as banyan trees engulfed the buildings thus replacing the structures created by man. This island makes you nostalgic and takes you back in time when this was an administrative settlement for the Britishers. The Indian Navy has rebuilt some of the old buildings like the bakery and the local stores, from where souvenirs are available.</p>
